# Log-Archive

Simple script to gather logs and compress them into a tar.gz file in your chosen directory.

To place it on your chosen directory, simply replace "r"C:\Users\lephia\Documents\Log_Archive" with the directory of your choice.

The script will also create a .txt file that will be placed on that same directory.
